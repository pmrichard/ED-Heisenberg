# ED-Heisenberg
An exact diagonalization practice for spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.


chain.m     //main program
numup.m     //count the number of 1 in a binary number
search.m    //bi-search
genmag.m    //generate basis via magnetization conversation


You need to change the size L in chain.m.

Next: the second blocking via translation symmetry.
