# ED-Heisenberg
An exact diagonalization practice for spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.


chain.m     main program
numup.m     count the number of 1 in a binary number
search.m    bi-search
genmag.m    generate basis via magnetization conversation


You need to change the size L in chain.m.

Next: the second blocking via translation symmetry.
